## Decision Tree

### 1. Objectiveness

Is the main purpose to objectively inform the reader? Does the text contain no or almost no subjective adjectives or adverbs (already, yet, only), words that convey certainty (surely, certainly) etc.?
* Yes, it is a report on a recent event - [News / Reporting](#news)
* Yes, it addresses the readers and notifies them about new circumstances, asking them to act accordingly- [Announcement](#announcement)
* Yes, it instructs the reader on how to do something - [Instruction](#instruction)
* Yes, it asks the readers to submit a paper, project proposal, original literary text etc., stating requirements and a deadline - [Call](#call)
* Yes, but it is none of the above - [Information / Explanation](#information)
* No/Not sure - go to the question [2. Subjective text](#q2)

### 2. Subjective text

What is the purpose of the text?
* To subjectively report on a recent event - [Opinionated News](#opinionated-news)
* To promote/sell products or services (a company) - go to [3. Promotion](#q-promotion)
* To convey opinion (no commercial purpose) - [Opinion / Argumentation](#opinion)
* To convey opinion on a product based on personal experiences - [Review](#review) 
* The purpose of the text is indiscernible / not covered by other categories - [Other](#other)

### 3. Promotion
Is the main purpose to promote/sell products or services? Does the text address the reader and includes subjective adjectives and adverbs?
* Yes, a product - [Promotion of a Product](#promotion-product)
* Yes, services/a company - [Promotion of Services](#promotion-services)
* Yes, but I am not sure whether it promotes products or services - [Promotion](#promotion)

If you are not sure, whether the text promotes a product or services, or if it promotes both, choose the main category - Promotion. If the 1st person is prevalent in the text, you could consider it as a Promotion of Services instead of a Promotion of a Product.
